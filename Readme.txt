Brief Explaination:
------------------
A project with comprehensive data preparation including label encoding, extraneous data removal, addressing missing values, and text normalization. Due to dataset asymmetry, the report aims to implement undersampling techniques to ensure reliable model training. The core objective is to train and validate four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, RandomForestClassifier, and MultilayerPerceptronClassifier, leveraging feature extraction and transformation strategies. The report will further emphasize optimizing these models through cross-validation, meticulous parameter tuning, and evaluating their performance based on metrics such as accuracy and F1 scores.
